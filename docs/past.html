<p><strong>Lessons in Code Review</strong></p>
<p>Abstract: As coding and computation increasingly permeate statistics and data science courses, it is important for students to not only learn coding syntax and language, but also how to communicate with other data scientists. Code review implements a consistent feedback loop between coder and reviewer(s) to systematically assess code quality and enhance team communication. While code review is a commonplace in industry, it is not often implemented in data science classrooms. In this talk, I will present insights gained from my MA study about students’ code review habits and discuss resources developed to help promote good code review practices, as well as lessons learned with regard to implementing code review in a community-based data science project.</p>

<li><strong>Activity 7:15-8:00 -</strong> Use of ChatGPT in the classroom–Yay or nay</li>
</ul>
<p>Description: Many of us might be trying to figure out how to use ChatGPT in the classroom. For example, questions you may be grappling with may include: How do we teach students to use it responsibly as a learning tool? Do we explicitly incorporate the use of it within our lessons? What policy should we have for when it is ok to use and when it is not ok to use in the classroom? Using a structured academic controversy activity, we will engage in a discussion to explore two sides of the use of ChatGPT in the classroom – yay or nay. The goal is to spark conversations about the use of the tool and generate a list of appropriate and inappropriate uses that could be implemented within our own classrooms.</p>

<p><br> <strong>Abstract:</strong> <a href="https://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/mererenovation/">“Mere Renovation is Too Little Too Late: We Need to Rethink Our Undergraduate Curriculum from the Ground Up”</a> is the title of a 2015 paper by George Cobb. Honoring George’s challenge, I have been rethinking and re-designing the introductory statistics course, replacing traditional foundations using modern materials and reconfiguring the living and working spaces to suit today’s applied statistical needs and projects. In the spirit of a “model house” used to demonstrate housing innovations, I’ll take you on a tour of my “model course,” whose materials are available free, open, and online. Among the features you’ll see: an accessible handling of causal reasoning, a unification of the course structure around modeling, a streamlined yet professional-quality computational platform, and an honest presentation of Null Hypothesis Testing that connects it to other, more current forms of statistical inference. + <a href="https://dtkaplan.github.io/Math300blog/posts/StatChat-10-2023/">Danny’s Notes</a> + <a href="https://dtkaplan.github.io/Lessons-in-statistical-thinking/">Lessons in Statistical Thinking Textbook</a> + <a href="https://dtkaplan.github.io/Math-300Z/">Day-by-day class notes and activities from Spring 2023</a> -</p>

<p><strong>NEW LOCATION:</strong> University of St.&nbsp;Thomas, <a href="https://campusmap.stthomas.edu/location/-M2Kgey8WZUWETUD6JIG">O’Shaghnessy Science Hall (OSS) 227</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>6:00–6:30 Settle In &amp; Eat</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>6:30–7:45 Guest Speaker:</strong> <a href="http://www.david-deliema.com/">David DeLiema</a> from the Educational Psychology Department at the University of Minnesota will discuss some of his work on how students productively respond to moments of failure in the learning process.<br></p>
<p><em>Bio:</em> David DeLiema is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, where he studies how moments of failure, playful experiences, embodied cognition, and epistemic cognition shape learning in computer science, family play outdoors, video games, and other STEM domains. Through research-practice partnerships, his research examines cognitive and psychological processes within the context of social interaction, and often takes place within technology-rich settings.</p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> When teachers, researchers, and students describe productively responding to moments of failure in the learning process, what might this mean? Drawing from studies of computer programming teaching and learning, this talk will explore the heterogeneous processes teachers and students value and pursue following moments in which computer bugs thwart students’ immediate progress on an activity. These include: (1) resolving the current bug; (2) avoiding recurring bugs; (3) preparing for novel bugs; (4) engaging with authority; and (5) calibrating confidence/ efficacy. In addition, this talk will examine the open-ended process of noticing bugs and the power-laden process of navigating refactoring in the classroom (e.g., how instructors request that students re-write working code in ways instructors judge to be more efficient/elegant). In all, this talk is meant to provide concrete points of reflection for how educators can support students with debugging in computer programming and with impasses in other STEM domains.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>6:00–6:30 Settle In &amp; Eat</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>6:30–7:45 Guest Speaker:</strong> <a href="https://cei.umn.edu/staff/kris-gorman">Kris Gorman</a> from the <em>Center for Educational Innovation</em> at the University of Minnesota will discuss the nebulous balance between breadth and depth in statistics education.<br></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> In order to help students retain information long term and transfer that knowledge to new situations, there’s research to suggest that rather than cover everything (i.e.&nbsp;provide full breadth), it’s better to cover some things more thoroughly (i.e.&nbsp;provide depth). Kris Gorman will share findings about depth vs breadth and a few examples of how instructors at UMN have altered courses to incorporate more depth. There will be time for discussion about what this might mean for choices in our own teaching.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>7:45–8:00:</strong> Discussion, wrap-up, and next StatChat (We need to pick place to have our first ever StatChat social.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We hope to see you there! If you plan to attend, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y09XZuKQyMPYnLZKgNV8cs2Bu3wY6Vr-Q1ZvM_8lUpE/edit#gid=0">please RSVP by signing up to bring food or beverage to share</a>.

<p>Our next StatChat is Wednesday February 26, 2020 from 6:00–8:00pm at Macalester College (Theater and Dance Building, Room 202). The agenda for the meeting will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>6:00–6:30 Settle In &amp; Eat</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>6:30–7:45 Guest Speaker:</strong> <a href="https://mdbeckman.github.io/">Matt Beckman</a> from the Statistics Department at Penn State will discuss Implementing version control as a learning objective in statistics courses.<br></p>
<p><em>Title:</em> Implementing version control as a learning objective in statistics courses using Git/Github</p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> Version control tools (e.g.&nbsp;Git/GitHub) are integral to a reproducible workflow. There are many resources out there for learning Git/Github, but most are written for people with more technical experience. How can we onboard students efficiently? How can we help students avoid common problems? This session intends to (1) introduce the audience to version control principles, (2) make a case for version control as a substantive learning objective in teaching/training statisticians and analysts, and (3) share resources and engage participants in implementation details to begin integrating Git/GitHub as a meaningful part of a statistics course. We will discuss an implementation model suitable for both technical and non-technical students without prior experience needed. We also discuss GitHub Classroom as a means to preserve academic integrity while still providing students real experience with tools designed to facilitate collaboration and code sharing. The session includes hands-on experiences with methods to first introduce GitHub to students, to streamline Git &amp; RStudio linkage, and to use GitHub Classroom to distribute assignments that include instructions, starter code, and data.</p></li>

<p><strong>Book Club 2019</strong></p>
<p>During the 2019 spring semester, StatChat will be reading and discussing <em>The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect</em> by Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Correlation is not causation.” This mantra, chanted by scientists for more than a century, has led to a virtual prohibition on causal talk. Today, that taboo is dead. The causal revolution, instigated by Judea Pearl and his colleagues, has cut through a century of confusion and established causality–the study of cause and effect–on a firm scientific basis. His work explains how we can know easy things, like whether it was rain or a sprinkler that made a sidewalk wet; and how to answer hard questions, like whether a drug cured an illness. Pearl’s work enables us to know not just whether one thing causes another: it lets us explore the world that is and the worlds that could have been. It shows us the essence of human thought and key to artificial intelligence. Anyone who wants to understand either needs The Book of Why.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Coincidence is much more likely than expected, leading many people to conclude that there is something more going on than “mere” coincidence. Educators often see this differently, and ponder how to lead students to a more accurate idea of “expected.” I’ll describe some spreadsheets to make the unseen more visible and help students challenge and develop their notion of “expected”. The spreadsheets demonstrate runs with coins, linear and non-linear clusters in a two-dimensional grid, and the Birthday problem.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What do we want out students to learn in an introductory statistics course? Historically, the answers have ranged from “How to compute …” to “How to read the newspaper” to “How to analyze data” to “It depends on who the students are.” Most of these discussions took place in a context in which data were hard to come by and statistical analysis tools were expensive. But today we live in a world where data are ubiquitous and anyone with an internet connection can analyze data. In this new data-driven world, I will argue that there is a core curriculum needed by all students, regardless of major and that the purpose of this core is to teach them to be Citizen Statisticians. We’ll discuss how the new textbook I wrote with Colleen Ryan, Introductory Statistics: Exploring The World Through Data, was written to provide a core statistics education to all students regardless of background or mathematical preparation.</p>

<li><strong>Guest Speaker:</strong> Daniel Kaplan (Macalester College)</li>
<li><strong>Topic:</strong> Recent U.S. Supreme Court Finding on Statistical Significance</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Supreme Court decisions famously reflect political divides, but they also are a product of the multiple simultaneous objectives of the legal system: creating incentives for honest behavior, distributing risk and cost among competing parties, and maintaining predictability, among others. Statistical theory was created for a completely different set of objectives, of which a major one is supporting an idealized scientific process of nonpartisan, disinterested investigation. The Matrixx case inhabits a domain where both sets of objectives apply: the desire for informed scientific judgment and the exigencies and conflicts of civic life. Whenever multiple objectives are involved, it’s likely that not all of the objectives will be fully realized. Or, to quote Dickens’s Mr.&nbsp;Bumble,”The law is an ass.” The question is whether statistics is likely to be any less so when dealing with complex matters of allocation and decision-making. I’ll discuss in particular the extent to which the canonical set of topics covered in university-level statistics education is oriented toward supporting quantitatively sophisticated, effective decision making in the civic domain.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It’s likely that you have two immediate reactions to the title. (1) R is for statistics, not calculus. If you’re going to use software at all for calculus — and it’s not clear that you should — you should use a symbolic algebra package like Mathematica or Maple. (2) I don’t teach (or study or use) calculus, so why should I care? In fact, it is more or less a historical accident that calculus is taught through algebra. In the late 1600s through 1900, that was the only technology that was available. The basic techniques of calculus — differentiation and integration — have no intrinsic relationship to the algebraic techniques. It’s perfectly reasonable to present them entirely as simple software operations. And why you should care? Many of your mathematical ideas were formed by the calculus-oriented high-school curriculum that you went through. In those high-school years, you were drilled with algebraic and symbolic techniques. So you’re good with algebra, even though you may rarely use it. Seeing how to represent and perform those operations with software can help you to develop general computational concepts and skills.</p>

<p>Checking assumptions is a critical activity in modeling. Often times the assumptions used in analyzing data influence – if not determine – the results. I’ll discuss an ISI draft paper that argues that statistics have the same status as models – they involve choices in assembly that influence – if not determine – the results. One of the five elements of the AACU 2009 Quantitative Literacy Rubric was assumptions: “Ability to make and evaluate important assumptions in estimation, modeling, and data analysis.” The ISI paper extends this focus on assumptions to include the formation of categories, measures and summary statistics. While statistics may have little to say about which assumptions are best, statistical literacy can highlight how choices in how groups are defined or how quantities are measured can influence the results.</p>

<p>In the case of US v. Shine et al., federal prosecutors in Burlington, Vermont wanted to send to jail a dozen accused drug dealers, all of them members of racial minorities. The defense team claimed that the citizens chosen to serve on the grand juries that had indicted the dozen accused dealers had been chosen using a jury selection method that was racially biased. If true, the legal rights of the accused under the US Constitution would have been violated, which would mean that they should be set free. The case involved a variety of issues, all statistical or mathematical, and so I was asked by the prosecutors to testify about these issues. In my talk I’ll describe one particularly simple mathematical problem that figured prominently in the case, and illustrate two different ways to think about it. For me, these two ways exemplify two very general strategies for solving mathematical problems.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In this course, we learn about the core descriptive, probabilistic, and inferential methods used in statistics. These topics will be motivated by using real data from a variety of sports. Quantitative analysis of sports data has become a serious research field. Baseball was the first North American sport to be studied by statisticians. The term coined by Bill James for this field, “sabermetrics”, is widely recognized in the statistical community, and many professional sports teams now employ academic statisticians to help them gain an advantage over the competition. The acceptance of sabermetrics (aided by the popularity of books like Moneyball) has led to quantitative research in other sports, as objective decision making continues to replace the haphazard “gut feelings” used in the past. The plethora of examples that are sports related are not restricted to “traditional” sports data. For example, we will discuss data on the graduation rates, and birthdays(!), of athletes. As we will see, at the core of this course is a desire to answer questions of interest in impartial and meaningful ways. Ultimately, this is a statistics course, so we learn about different methods used to analyze data. But we will not lose sight of the fact that, in statistics, the final analysis is only one aspect of the process used to answer questions. For example, measurement issues are a crucial, but often overlooked, piece of the puzzle: What metric(s) should we use to decide which of two players is better? How do we assess strategies in a game?</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I know, you’re thinking this is going to be a session about Bayesian inference. But it’s just good ol’ hypothesis testing. In looking through standard statistics texts and comparing what they say to what I do in my introductory classes, I’ve been struck by the very limited role that the alternative hypothesis plays. The alternative seems to be entirely about whether to do a one-sided or two-sided test, and is written in very abstract terms, e.g., Ha : p &gt; 0.5. In my classes, I have the students work with very specific alternative hypotheses, e.g., p = 0.70. This has several advantages. It makes it clearer to the student that both the null and the alternative are ‘hypotheticals’, statements about world that might or might not be true. It also relates statistical practice more closely to scientific practice, where a person designing a study has to think about how big is the effect he or she is looking for. This leads directly to calculations of sample size and power. I’ll show some settings in which I have students do these calculations.</p>

<p>In a classroom setting, students can engage in hands-on activities in order to better understand certain concepts and ideas. Replicating hands-on activities in an online environment, however, can be a challenge for instructors. Recently, at the University of Minnesota, we created two web applets to incorporate into our undergraduate online introductory statistics courses, and these applets are meant to provide opportunities for students to engage in the kinds of activities commonly used in comparable classroom sections. One applet goes along with an activity where students use Post-it Notes in an effort to develop a more conceptual understanding of the mean and the median, and the other applet is meant to replicate aspects of the famous “Gummy Bears in Space” activity (presented in Schaeffer, Gnanadesikan, Watkins &amp; Witmer, 1996). This talk will focus on the development of these applets and the ways in which the applets are currently used in our online courses.</p>
