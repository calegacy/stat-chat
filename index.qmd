An informal but informative get-together of local statistics educators in the Twin-Cities

# **Wednesday, Nov. 6, from 6-8pm**

**LOCATION: University of St. Thomas St Paul campus, Owens Science Hall (OWS) 275 (**details of where to park and how to navigate there below).

\
We are planning to make the most of our time together this academic year by hosting a **Pedagogical Potluck**! We would like to crowdsource your favorite pedagogical tips and tricks, activities, assessments, datasets or resources. This can take many forms: \

<div style="text-align: left"> 

-   Do you have a favorite way to get to know your students?

-   Do you have the PERFECT way of introducing your students to coding or to understand the importance of variability?

-   Do you have a trick for getting students to work in groups and get off their cell phones?

-   Do you have an amazing dataset?

-   Do you have an engaging activity you use with students?

-   Do you have an authentic or useful assessment?



We want to hear about it! For our meeting in November, we will highlight 5–6 of these tips by having people do lightning talk (3–5 minutes) and brief Q&A about their topic. \
\
Sign-up in [**this google form**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://forms.gle/eTaS4n7Pf2GW4JA78&source=gmail-imap&ust=1729519064000000&usg=AOvVaw0vbTms0Oqfe4vGIEpYYAlg) to volunteer something for Pedagogical Potluck. We will follow up in a few weeks with additional information once we have submissions come in. We are also planning on doing the same thing in our spring meeting, so if we have more than 5-6 ideas we will get to those at that time.

Some extra details are below:

-   Check out the [StatChat website](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://calegacy.github.io/stat-chat/&source=gmail-imap&ust=1729519064000000&usg=AOvVaw0sf9ytAE2H7tIdF1ncvb3h) for updates and emerging details about this and all other events.

-   If you're able to attend, please [RSVP here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cfeGRUqxHDtIZuf0HkclAfN-37V-zXeGVQWGIXDEgX4/edit?gid%3D0%23gid%3D0&source=gmail-imap&ust=1729519064000000&usg=AOvVaw1dm4IcqzU7Gfmz43jpec35) and indicate whether you can bring a snack to add to *food* potluck. Note that we'll be in a room which does not have easy access to a kitchen, dishes, serving implements, etc. Please keep this in mind in determining what to bring / how to bring it.



-   Parking options:

    -   Free street parking is available around campus. There are some good places on Summit Ave or Goodrich Ave west of Cretin. **Note: Summit Ave only has free parking on the South side; North is residential and tow-away. Goodrich Ave is free on the North side.**

    -   Paid parking is available in the Anderson Parking Facility for \$1.55/hour. Park your car, then pay at the automated kiosk (license plate number required). There will be many spaces available, and the garage is across the street from where we will meet.

-   Finding the room:

    -   Notice that we are meeting in a different building than we have previously. OWS is the building that is closest to the Anderson parking facility.
