An informal but informative get-together of local statistics educators in the Twin-Cities

## November 29th, 2023 Meeting

We will be at **University of St. Thomas St Paul campus, O'Shaghnessy Science Hall (OSS) 227** (details of where to park and how to navigate there below).

The format this time will be a little different than previous times. The first part (after the social time) will be a short presentation on Code Review from Regina Lisinker, a graduate student from the University of Minnesota, followed by an interactive activity to discuss the use of ChatGPT in the classroom. Here's the information for both:

### **Presentation: Lessons in Code Review**

Abstract: As coding and computation increasingly permeate statistics and data science courses, it is important for students to not only learn coding syntax and language, but also how to communicate with other data scientists. Code review implements a consistent feedback loop between coder and reviewer(s) to systematically assess code quality and enhance team communication. While code review is a commonplace in industry, it is not often implemented in data science classrooms. In this talk, I will present insights gained from my MA study about students' code review habits and discuss resources developed to help promote good code review practices, as well as lessons learned with regard to implementing code review in a community-based data science project.

### **Activity: Use of ChatGPT in the classroom--Yay or nay?**

Description: Many of us might be trying to figure out how to use ChatGPT in the classroom. For example, questions you may be grappling with may include: How do we teach students to use it responsibly as a learning tool? Do we explicitly incorporate the use of it within our lessons? What policy should we have for when it is ok to use and when it is not ok to use in the classroom?

Using a structured academic controversy activity, we will engage in a discussion to explore two sides of the use of ChatGPT in the classroom -- yay or nay. The goal is to spark conversations about the use of the tool and generate a list of appropriate and inappropriate uses that could be implemented within our own classrooms. Also, if you have language about appropriate (and/or inappropriate) use of ChatGPT in your classroom, please copy-and-paste that into this document (if you are willing to share).

### **Extra Details**

If you're able to attend, please [RSVP here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z0LG75TumN79pfdetZ2S7J3aTYMbTA_Y9cDiadHP6W4/edit#gid=0) and indicate whether you can bring a snack to add to the pile. Note that we'll be in a room which does not have easy access to a kitchen, dishes, serving implements, etc. Please keep this in mind in determining what to bring / how to bring it.

#### **Parking options:**

-   **Free street parking** is available around campus. Amelia McNemara (our StatChat host) recommends Summit Ave or Goodrich Ave west of Cretin. For example, enter 2214 Goodrich Ave into your GPS to get to the block of Goodrich she is suggesting. **However, Summit Ave has free parking on the South side, North is residential and tow-away. Goodrich Ave is free on the North side.**

-   **Paid parking** is available in the Anderson Parking Facility for \$1.55/hour. Park your car, then pay at the automated kiosk (license plate number required). There will be many spaces available, and the garage is across the street from where we will meet.

#### **Finding the room:** 

We will be meeting in OSS, which is one of two connected science buildings at the corner of Summit and Cretin avenues. The building closest to the Anderson parking facility is OWS, the one closer to Summit is OSS. The two buildings (OWS and OSS) do not share the numbering, so there is no danger in getting to a wrong 227. Anything 250 and up will be OWS, below 250 will be OSS. If you are around room numbers above 250, walk through the connecting hallway/skyway (noticeable because of all the windows) to the other building.
