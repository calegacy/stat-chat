An informal but informative get-together of local statistics educators in the Twin-Cities

## April 10, 2024 Meeting

We will be at **University of St. Thomas St Paul campus, O'Shaghnessy Science Hall (OSS) 127** (details of where to park and how to navigate there below). ***Note this is the same building, but a different classroom from our usual spot.***

### **Presentation: Claire Kelling from Carleton College**

### **Extra Details**

If you're able to attend, please [RSVP here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z0LG75TumN79pfdetZ2S7J3aTYMbTA_Y9cDiadHP6W4/edit?usp=sharing) and indicate whether you can bring a snack to add to the pile. Note that we'll be in a room which does not have easy access to a kitchen, dishes, serving implements, etc. Please keep this in mind in determining what to bring / how to bring it.

#### **Parking options:**

-   **Free street parking** is available around campus. Amelia McNamara (our StatChat host) recommends Summit Ave or Goodrich Ave west of Cretin. For example, enter 2214 Goodrich Ave into your GPS to get to the block of Goodrich she is suggesting. **However, Summit Ave has free parking on the South side, North is residential and tow-away. Goodrich Ave is free on the North side.**

-   **Paid parking** is available in the Anderson Parking Facility for \$1.55/hour. Park your car, then pay at the automated kiosk (license plate number required). There will be many spaces available, and the garage is across the street from where we will meet.

#### **Finding the room:**

We will be meeting in OSS, which is one of two connected science buildings at the corner of Summit and Cretin avenues. The building closest to the Anderson parking facility is OWS, the one closer to Summit is OSS.
