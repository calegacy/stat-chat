An informal but informative get-together of local statistics educators in the Twin-Cities

## November TBD, 2023 Meeting

We hope to see you there!

<!-- If you plan to attend, [please RSVP by signing up to bring food or beverage to share](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y09XZuKQyMPYnLZKgNV8cs2Bu3wY6Vr-Q1ZvM_8lUpE/edit#gid=0).  And please spread the word among any colleagues that may be interested in the night's topics. -->

<!-- **Parking options:** -->

<!-- Free street parking is available around campus. Amelia McNemara (our StatChat host) recommends Summit Ave or Goodrich Ave west of Cretin. For example, enter 2214 Goodrich Ave into your GPS to get to the block of Goodrich she is suggesting. **_However, Summit Ave has free parking on the South side, North is residential and tow-away. Goodrich Ave is free on North side._** -->

<!-- Paid parking is available in the Anderson Parking Facility for $1.55/hour. Park your car, then pay at the automated kiosk (license plate number required). There will be many spaces available, and the garage is across the street from where we will meet. -->

<!-- **Finding the room:** -->

<!-- We will be meeting in OSS, which is one of two connected science buildings at the corner of Summit and Cretin avenues. The building closest to the Anderson parking facility is OWS, the one closer to Summit is OSS. The two buildings (OWS and OSS) share the numbering, so there is no danger in getting to a wrong 226. Anything 250 and up will be OWS, below: OSS. If you are around rooms below 250, walk through the connecting hallway/skyway (noticeable because of all the windows) to the other building. -->
